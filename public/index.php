                            <p>Greetings! My name is Brian. I've got an interesting history when it comes to programming. It all started with learning BASIC on a Texas Instruments calculator to give me answers for formula problems when I was in middle school. It moved on to learning C/C++ in high school using a "For Dummies" book. Not long after I graduated I was doing tech support for a web hosting company and teaching myself everything web related while also attending college in the evenings. I still remember the days of having to do nested div tags to get rounded corners!</p>
                            <p>For the last decade I have worked with WordPress and Laravel extensively and moved on from jQuery to using VueJS. I've been using Linux to self-host many things and also use it as my desktop and laptop OS of choice.</p>
                            <p>I'm available for all kinds of work right now, so feel free to reach out to me.</p>
                            <p>You can find links to my GitHub profile and other places on the External Links tab.</p>
                            <p>You can find my résumé <a class="text-link" href="<?php echo DOMAIN; ?>/Brian Rogers Résumé.pdf" title="Brian Rogers' Résumé">here</a>.</p>
